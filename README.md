# Interactive Guess Who Game Board

## Introduction

Welcome to my Interactive Guess Who Game Board! This application allows you to bring the classic guessing game into the digital age with a customizable touch. Add any characters you like and challenge your friends to a game of wits and deduction.

## How to Use

### Preparing Your Characters

1. To begin, prepare a character file following the template: `<url> <name>`. Here is an example:
```
https://example.com/character1.png Character1
https://example.com/character2.png Character2
```
**Note:** Ensure each character is on a new line.

2. Gather all character URLs and names in a plain text file. Contents of this file will be used to load characters into the game.

### Setting Up the Game

1. Paste the contents of the file into the Links field

2. Decide on the number of characters you want to play with. Both players should agree on the same number to ensure fairness.

3. One player generates a game seed by closing the pop-up window that appears upon the game's start. This will ensure a unique game setup.

4. The seed should copy to the clipboard automatically. Send the generated seed to the other player.

### Starting the Game

1. Both players enter the shared seed into their respective game boards.

2. The game will load with the characters positioned randomly based on the seed with your character in a green border.

3. Begin asking yes or no questions to narrow down the possible characters your opponent has chosen.
